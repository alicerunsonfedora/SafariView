# ``SafariView``

Present a Safari view controller in your iOS apps using SwiftUI on iOS 13+.

## Overview

You can use SafariView to integrate Safari seamlessly into your apps for iOS and iPadOS using SwiftUI.
``SafariView/SafariView`` provides a wrapper around the `SFSafariViewController` developers are familiar with, while
providing a modern design to customizing the controller.

In the example screenshot below, A ``SafariView/SafariView`` is used to display a web page to _Give Me A Sniglet_'s bug
reporter.
